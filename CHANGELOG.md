## [0.3.1] - 2026-01-24

### Fixed

#### Uptime Module - Nullability & Visibility Fixes

**Monitor Visibility Bug:**
- Fixed monitors not appearing in the UI after creation
- Backend returns array directly for `/monitors` endpoint, but frontend expected `{ monitors: [], total }` format
- Updated API client to normalize response formats across all uptime endpoints

**API Response Format Alignment:**
- `monitors.list()` - Now correctly handles array response from backend
- `incidents.list()` - Now correctly handles `{ items: [] }` response format
- `monitors.getChecks()` - Now correctly handles `{ items: [] }` response format

**Unknown Status Handling:**
- Added `unknown` status support for newly created monitors (before first check runs)
- Added `unknown` to `STATUS_COLORS` in all uptime pages to prevent render crashes
- Added `DEFAULT_STATUS_STYLE` fallback for unrecognized status values

**Null-Safe Data Handling:**
- Added optional chaining (`?.`) when accessing API response properties
- Added fallback to empty arrays (`|| []`) for all list data
- Added error state resets in catch blocks to prevent stale data display
- Fixed `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` errors

**Files Updated:**
- `frontend/src/lib/uptime-api.ts` - API response normalization
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/page.tsx` - Dashboard null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/monitors/page.tsx` - Monitors list null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/monitors/[monitorId]/page.tsx` - Monitor detail null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/incidents/page.tsx` - Incidents list null safety
- `frontend/src/app/(app)/uptime/incidents/[incidentId]/page.tsx` - Incident detail null safety
