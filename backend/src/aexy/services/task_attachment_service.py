"""Shared task-attachment helpers.

Used by both the sprint-scoped router (`/sprints/{sprint_id}/tasks/{task_id}/attachments`)
and the project-scoped router (`/teams/{team_id}/tasks/{task_id}/attachments`)
so backlog tasks (no sprint) can carry attachments using the same code path.

Permission and ownership checks live in the routers — these helpers assume
the caller has already authorised the operation against `task`.
