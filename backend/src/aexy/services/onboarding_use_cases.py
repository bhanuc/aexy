"""What the onboarding use-case picks actually configure.

Onboarding asks "what will you use Aexy for?" and the answer used to be applied
to exactly one thing: the founder's own ``app_permissions`` row. The workspace
itself learned nothing, so every person invited afterwards fell back to their
legacy role — which meant the Engineering bundle for anyone whose role read
"member". A founder who chose "CRM & Sales" and then invited their first
salesperson gave them standups, sprints and on-call, and no CRM.

So the picks now configure three things:

* **the workspace** — apps nobody selected are switched off, which is the only
  layer that was ever enforced and the honest meaning of "we don't use that";
* **departments** — each pick seeds one, carrying the access profile its people
  should have and the sidebar view that suits them;
* **nothing about the founder** — as owner they resolve to full access anyway,
  and writing them an override would pin them out of every later change.

The mapping lives here, in Python, because it is now the server's decision. The
frontend's copy (``onboarding/complete/page.tsx``) previously owned it and had
already drifted: it enabled ``insights`` for engineering while the Engineering
bundle in ``app_definitions`` does not, so the same choice produced different
access depending on which code path applied it.
