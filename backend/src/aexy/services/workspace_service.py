    There were two answers to "is this person an admin" and they disagreed.
    `check_permission` scored `member.role` — the legacy column, which stays
    `"member"` when a custom role is assigned, because `role` and `role_id`
    coexist. `AppAccessService._is_admin` scored the custom role. So a member
    holding a custom admin-equivalent role was granted every app by the access
    layer, shown the controls that go with them, and then refused by the
    endpoint behind each one: `is_admin: true` from
    `/app-access/members/{id}/effective`, 403 from `PATCH` beside it.

    The data model already says which of the two is right — `role_id` is
    documented as taking precedence over the legacy role — so this resolves the
    custom role and takes the *higher* of the two. Higher rather than the custom
    role alone, deliberately: a custom role is additive in intent, and letting
    one lower an owner to whatever its template says would be a way to demote
    somebody by assigning them a job title.

    Both callers use this now, so the two answers cannot drift apart again.

    Reads `member.custom_role` directly, which is safe because the relationship
    is `lazy="selectin"` — every `WorkspaceMember` query already loads it, so
    this costs no extra round trip and cannot be silently absent.
