"""Channel-aware outbound for the Service Desk.

For a Gmail-synced mailbox, replies are sent through the Gmail API as the
mailbox address and threaded into the requester's original conversation. For a
webhook mailbox (or if Gmail send fails), it falls back to the transactional
``EmailService``. All sends are best-effort — callers never depend on delivery.
