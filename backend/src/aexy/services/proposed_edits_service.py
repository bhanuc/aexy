"""Service for the AI-suggestion approval queue.

`ProposedChange` rows sit between AI output and the canonical
`Document.content`. The legacy regenerate flow used to overwrite
content directly; this service is the new path:

  - `create(doc_id, source, content)` records a pending proposal and
    auto-supersedes any older pending proposals on the same doc (so
    nightly batch runs don't stack N proposals).
  - `approve(pe_id)` applies the content via DocumentService, which
    bumps the version chain, then marks the proposal approved.
  - `reject(pe_id, reason)` keeps the doc untouched and records the
    reason for audit.
  - `list_pending(doc_id)` powers the FE banner; each result carries
    a computed `is_stale` flag (proposal's `base_content_sha` no
    longer matches the document's current content SHA).

The FE groups results by `source` and renders a merge-conflict UX
when `is_stale=True`.
