"""Turning a Word document into issues, in two steps.

A document arrives with work in it — a numbered requirements spec, a client's
review with twenty comments in the margin, a QA report where every finding is a
defect. Retyping that into a board is the job nobody does, so it stays in the
document and stops being tracked.

**Two steps, on purpose.** ``preview`` reads and proposes; ``create`` writes.
Nothing reaches a board until a person has seen the list and taken things off it.
That is not politeness — these rows become work a team is measured against, and a
model that mistook a heading for a deliverable would put a phantom task in
somebody's sprint. The same reasoning the edit path uses for its redline gate,
with a lighter mechanism because there is no document to mark up.

**Both pickers belong to the run, not the workspace.** The same document read for
"unresolved comments → tickets" and for "requirements → sprint tasks" is two
different asks, and a workspace-level default would make one of them wrong. So
the caller names the sources and the target every time.

The three sources answer different questions and combine:

* ``comments`` — every open comment thread. What a reviewer actually marked up,
  and the highest-signal source in a document that has been through review.
  Reuses the extraction the ``@aexy`` trigger reads.
* ``markers`` — ``TODO``, ``ACTION``, ``FIXME`` and friends in the body text.
  Predictable and free: no model call, no cost, and no judgement.
* ``model`` — the AI reads the document and proposes a list. Finds work that is
  neither commented nor tagged, which is most of it in a spec written by
  somebody who was not thinking about a tracker.
