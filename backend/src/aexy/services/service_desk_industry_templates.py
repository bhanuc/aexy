"""Industry templates: the vocabulary a Service Desk starts life with.

The module used to *be* an insurance desk. ``RequestType`` and ``PendingWith``
were Python enums, so "who can a ticket be pending with" was a deploy-time
decision — no workspace could add a Legal stakeholder or a Refund request type
without a migration. Three master-data tables were named after insurance
counterparties, and row-level visibility was wired to department function keys
like ``ops_kam`` by a dict no admin could see, let alone edit.

The schema underneath is generic now (``service_desk_stakeholders`` and
``service_desk_request_types``, both per workspace). This file is the catalogue
of starting points that populates it, so a new desk isn't a blank page.

**No template contains company-identifying data.** A template describes a
*shape* — the stakeholders a claims desk hands off between, the request types a
support desk triages into. Names, mailboxes, real accounts and staff are
supplied when a template is applied; the desk's own name defaults to the
workspace name. That separation is the point: "insurance broking" is reusable,
any one customer's name is not.

Two rules hold the whole design together:

* Code branches on ``semantics``, never on ``slug`` or ``label``. A workspace
  renaming "Insurer" to "Underwriter" must not change TAT maths. Same reason
  ``WorkspaceStatusCategory.semantics`` exists for sprint statuses.
* The ``insurance_broking`` slugs are frozen at the legacy enum values
  (``kam``, ``insurer``, ``third_party``, …). Existing rows in
  ``service_desk_tickets.pending_with`` and ``ticket_pending_segments`` hold
  those strings, so reusing them is what lets a live desk adopt this without a
  data rewrite.
