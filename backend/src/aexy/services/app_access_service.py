"""App access resolution and management service.

This service decides which apps and modules a workspace member can see and
reach.

Resolution order, lowest precedence first:

1. **Workspace app settings** — the owner's on/off switch. A module the
   workspace has turned off is off for everybody, admins included.
2. **Department profile** — the union of the access profiles of every
   department the person belongs to. This is the baseline, and it is what makes
   access department-centric: a salesperson's departments decide they see CRM,
   not the fact that their legacy workspace role happens to read "member".
3. **Role fallback** — used *only* when none of the person's departments carries
   a profile (including when they are in no department at all). Before
   departments owned this, role was the baseline for everyone, which is why
   every "member" resolved to the Engineering bundle regardless of their job.
4. **Member override** — an explicit, per-app grant or revoke, stored as a
   *delta* so that everything not mentioned keeps inheriting. Overrides used to
   be stored as a full snapshot of every app, which meant that toggling one app
   for one person silently froze all their other apps forever.

Two separate questions come out of this, and conflating them is what made
admins unable to ever see a shorter sidebar:

* ``enabled`` — should this app be in your navigation?
* ``can_access`` — should the API let you in? Admins and owners are always
  allowed to reach an app that the workspace has enabled, whatever their
  profile says, because they have to be able to administer it. And an app that
  reached ``role_fallback`` — nobody configured it for this person — stays
  reachable: enforcement follows configuration rather than preceding it, so
  adopting this model can't retroactively lock anyone out of an app they use
  today. See the comment at that branch.

Every app also carries a ``source`` explaining which layer decided it, so both
the admin UI and a support conversation can answer "why can this person see
that?" without re-deriving the chain by hand.
