"""Per-workspace Service Desk identity: the ticket prefix.

The prefix was a module constant, ``TICKET_PREFIX = "BSD"`` — short for one
customer's desk — written independently in the intake service, the ticket service
and the digest service. Every other company using the module would have had its
tickets numbered ``BSD-41``, with no way to change it without a code edit.

It lives in ``Workspace.settings["service_desk"]["ticket_prefix"]`` now, and the
default is the neutral ``SD``.

One property worth knowing: the prefix is **not stored on the ticket**. Display
ids are rendered from ``ticket_number`` on read, so changing a workspace's prefix
relabels its existing tickets too, and subject-line threading for mail already in
flight stops matching. That is the right trade for a desk being set up; it would
not have been for one already corresponding with customers.
