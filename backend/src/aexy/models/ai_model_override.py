"""Which model a workspace wants for one AI feature, or one whole category.

A table rather than another key in ``workspace.settings``, for two reasons that
both bit somewhere else first.

``workspace.settings`` is one JSONB blob already shared by ``ai_analysis``,
``app_settings``, ``service_desk`` and ``rate_limit_overrides``. Writing a key
means read-modify-write of the whole thing, and the configuration screen this
backs has fifty rows on it — two admins saving at once silently loses one of the
two saves, and neither of them can tell.

And these rows move money. ``updated_by_id`` and ``updated_at`` are the first
thing anybody asks for when a bill jumps, and a blob cannot answer it.

Two scopes in one table rather than two tables: the resolution order reads them
together (feature, then category, then the workspace default), and splitting
them would mean two queries and two places to keep the same uniqueness rule.

**No row means inherit**, at every level. There is no "same as the default"
value to distinguish from "not set" — a Reset deletes the row rather than
writing the value that is currently effective, so the row keeps following the
default when an admin changes it later.
