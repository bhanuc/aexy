"""One record for anything waiting on a human to approve it.

Two gates produce this work. The **content gate** holds a result — prose an
AI wrote, to be diffed against the page it would replace. The **policy gate**
holds an intent — a tool call stopped before it ran, because running it to see
what it would do is what the gate exists to prevent.

Those are genuinely different things, and an earlier draft of this argued they
should stay in separate tables on the strength of that. The objection was to a
specific bad shape: eighteen columns that only apply to one kind, half of them
null on every row, with a discriminator telling you which half to ignore.

Putting the kind-specific part in one JSONB `payload` removes that objection
entirely. What is left is genuinely common — who asked, when, what for, what
was decided — and a single table means one queue, one lifecycle, one place to
add a third kind, and a review inbox that is a query rather than a merge of
two lists in the client.
