"""Everything in this workspace waiting on a person to decide.

Two gates produce work for humans, and they store it differently on purpose:
the content gate holds a *result* to diff against a page, the policy gate holds
an *intent* that has not run yet. `ProposedChange` holds both, with the
kind-specific part in its payload, so this is one query rather than a merge of
two lists in the client.

What this adds on top of the table is the *envelope* a reviewer reads: a title,
a line of plain language, and whether it needs attention — computed here rather
than stored, because staleness depends on the record as it is right now.
