"""Reusable FastAPI dependencies for enforcing workspace app (module) access.

Workspace admins can disable a module for the whole workspace, but that toggle
was never enforced on the API — only the sidebar hid the module. These
dependencies close the API hole:

- ``require_app_access`` for routers whose paths carry ``{workspace_id}``.
- ``require_app_access_sprint_scoped`` for routers whose paths carry
  ``{sprint_id}``/``{team_id}`` and resolve the workspace server-side.
- ``require_app_access_document_scoped`` for routers whose paths carry
  ``{document_id}``.
- ``ensure_app_enabled`` for endpoints that resolve the workspace id
  themselves (body/query params, or via a referenced entity).
