# a process has exactly one loop for its lifetime (the normal FastAPI/Temporal
# case), but anything that runs multiple event loops in the same process --
# pytest-asyncio's per-test loop being the case that actually hit this --
# would reuse an engine whose pooled asyncpg connections belong to a loop
# that has since closed, failing every query with "Event loop is closed" on

# not id(loop): id() is a memory address, and a garbage-collected loop's
# address can be handed to an unrelated loop created moments later -- which
# would silently collide two different loops onto the same cache entry and
# hand the new one an engine bound to the old, already-closed loop. Keying on
# the object's identity while it's alive sidesteps that, and the entry is
# evicted automatically once its loop is collected, so this doesn't grow
# without bound across a long test run either.
