"""Document tools for AI agents.

Reading and creating workspace documents, Word documents included.

These deliberately stop short of *editing* an existing document. An agent that
rewrites a document in place has no way to know which sentences a person wrote
and cared about, and a silent overwrite leaves nothing to compare against — the
version history records what changed but never that anyone disagreed. Aexy
already has the answer to that (`ProposedChange`, the review gate the Docs UI
renders as a banner), and wiring a Word document into it needs tracked changes to
be reviewable as a redline rather than a diff of two opaque files. That is the
next phase; until then an agent reads and creates, and a person edits.
