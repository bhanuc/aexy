# =============================================================================
# MODULE SCOPE
# Automations were CRM-only from 2026-07-15 because no other module dispatched
# trigger events — the condition the descope note set for re-activation was
# "add it to ENABLED_MODULES and wire its trigger dispatch". Every module in
# TRIGGER_REGISTRY now dispatches: crm through CRMEventService.process_trigger,
# the other nine through dispatch_automation_event() (tickets in ticket_service
# + alert_ingestion_service, hiring in hiring/api + hiring_intelligence +
# assessment_take, email_marketing in campaign_service + email_tracking, uptime
# in uptime_service, sprints in sprint_service/sprint_task_service/epic_service/
# sprint_analytics_service, forms in form_submission_handler, booking in
# booking_service + activities/booking, tracking in tracking_events, compliance
# in compliance_service + activities/compliance_automation), so all ten are
# offered again.
#
# Enabling a module does NOT mean every entry in its registry is live. Triggers
# nothing emits, and actions with no executor on both run paths, stay withheld
# per module below — the palette must never offer a step that cannot run.
