# in a developer's `backend/.env` is their own Postgres.
#
# Demonstrated rather than assumed: with DATABASE_URL pointed at a nonexistent
# host, `test_api_health.py::test_readiness_check` returned 503. That test was
# asserting the developer's database was reachable, not that the code worked.
# `integrations.py` reaches the same helper on paths that commit.
#
# Redirecting settings also brings those call sites under the guard above — the
# schema a test may drop and the database the application talks to are now the
# same one, which is the property the guard was written to protect.
#
# The environment variable is set first, and it is the half that actually holds.
# Assigning the attribute mutates the one cached `Settings` instance, so any test
# that calls `get_settings.cache_clear()` throws the redirect away and the next
# `get_settings()` rebuilds from `backend/.env` — the developer's own database.
# `tests/ai/test_ask_evals.py` clears the cache autouse, before every case, which
# is how its tool calls came to re-enter the application against a real database
# rather than the rows the eval had just seeded. `Settings` reads DATABASE_URL
# from the environment, so a rebuild lands back here instead.

    `aexy.core.database` caches one engine per PID, on purpose — forked workers
    need that. But pytest-asyncio gives every test its own event loop, and both
    aiosqlite and asyncpg bind a connection to the loop that opened it. So the
    first test to reach any of the ~40 call sites of `get_async_session` — the
    readiness check was the one doing it — left a cached engine that every later
    test then drove from a loop that no longer existed.

    Measured before this fixture: created by
    `test_api_health.py::test_readiness_check`, then reused across a different
    loop in 76 subsequent tests.

    What that produced was not a clean error but nondeterministic nonsense —
    values arriving mid-flush with entirely the wrong type, surfacing as
    `'float' object has no attribute 'replace'` inside `uuid.UUID.__init__`, or a
    `uuid.UUID` with no `int` attribute, in whichever unrelated test happened to
    be running. One arbitrary red test per full run, never reproducible alone.

    Disposed on teardown rather than only cleared, while the loop that created
    the connection is still the current one; best-effort because a loop already
    closed makes disposal itself raise, and a leaked connection in a test process
    is a great deal better than a shared one.
