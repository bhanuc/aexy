"""The application's own engine must point at the test database.

`app.dependency_overrides[get_db]` redirects every *injected* session, which is
most of them. It cannot redirect `get_async_session()`, because that is called
directly rather than injected — and roughly forty places call it, among them
`health`, `event_ingestion`, `planning_poker`, `email_tracking`, `automations`,
`crm_automation` and `integrations`. Those built their engine from
`settings.database_url`, which in a developer's `backend/.env` is their own
Postgres.

So two databases were in play during one test run. The demonstrated consequence
was `test_api_health.py::TestHealthEndpoints::test_readiness_check` returning 503
when `DATABASE_URL` pointed at an unreachable host: that test asserted the
developer's database was up, not that the code worked. `integrations.py` reaches
the same helper on paths that commit, so the exposure was not only reads.

The fix is one line in `conftest.py`. These tests exist because nothing else
would notice it being removed — the suite would simply go back to passing for the
wrong reason on any machine with a healthy dev database.
