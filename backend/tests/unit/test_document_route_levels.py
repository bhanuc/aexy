"""Every document route has a deliberate access floor.

This file exists because of a mistake made while fixing the original one.

`guard_document_route` was added as a router-level dependency so that a route
which forgets to check access still fails closed — and it did, at **VIEW**. An
audit of the router afterwards found nine write endpoints relying on that
default: creating and deleting code links, GitHub sync setup, export and
import, AI generation, applying a suggestion, approving a proposed edit, and
`PUT /{id}/docx`, which overwrites a Word document's bytes. All of them were
gated at read level. Better than the nothing they had before, and still wrong.

So the floor now comes from the HTTP method — a write needs EDIT unless it is a
listed exception — and this test enumerates the routes so the next endpoint is
a decision rather than a default nobody looked at.

It asserts three things:

1. every `{document_id}` route resolves to a floor;
2. no write sits below EDIT unless it is in `_WRITE_LEVEL_EXCEPTIONS`, which
   carries a written reason for each;
3. the exceptions table has no stale entries — a path that no longer exists
   would be a silent hole if a route were later added at that path.

    `include_router` lazy: the top-level list holds `_IncludedRouter`
    placeholders with no `.path`, so reading one straight off it found
    nothing. The guard below caught that and failed loudly, which is more than
    the sibling check in `test_app_gating.py` managed — but the damage was
    quieter than the one red test suggests. `_document_routes()` feeds
    `@pytest.mark.parametrize`, and an empty list generates *no cases*: every
    per-route assertion in this file, the one keeping a write endpoint from
    sitting at read level, silently had nothing to assert.
