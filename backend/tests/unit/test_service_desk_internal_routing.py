"""Routing mail that a colleague sent, not a counterparty.

Reported from a live desk: "tickets are still not getting assigned correctly."
Three tickets arrived from the same person, about the same client, on the same
afternoon, and landed on three different owners.

All three came from the desk's own domain, which intake used to treat as a dead
end. It looked for a forwarded message and, finding none, handed the ticket to
whoever ``_random_owner`` picked. But a colleague writing *out* to a counterparty
with the desk copied names that counterparty in ``To:``, and a desk that has
mapped a colleague's own address to an account has said where their mail belongs.
Both answers were sitting in Master Data and neither was ever read.

Every case here is about which of those sources decides, and — just as
important — which addresses must never decide anything.
