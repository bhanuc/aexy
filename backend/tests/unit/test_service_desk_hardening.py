"""Regression tests for Service Desk intake hardening.

Each test pins a specific defect found in review:
- a "Re: SD-<n>" subject threading onto a GENERIC ticket (shared ticket_number)
- redelivered replies being appended twice (idempotency only covered the first
  message of a thread)
- a reply to a closed ticket landing silently instead of reopening it
- the acknowledgement email being sent before the transaction committed
- auto-assignment picking someone who has left the workspace
