"""Governance on the surface agents actually write through.

`McpToolExecutor` re-enters the app with a scoped token, so permissions were
always enforced. Governance — may an agent do this *unattended*? — was modelled
in full by `AgentPolicyEngine` and evaluated in exactly one place, for CRM
agents, while the MCP tool surface consulted none of it.

These assert on what does and does not reach the application: a refusal that
still performed the call and undid it afterwards would pass any test that only
checked the returned message.
