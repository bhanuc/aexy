"""Unit tests for what onboarding's use-case picks configure.

The picks used to be written to the founder's own member row and nowhere else,
so the workspace never learned what it was for. These tests pin the three things
that must now hold: the workspace gets configured, departments get seeded with a
profile, and the two layers cannot contradict each other.
