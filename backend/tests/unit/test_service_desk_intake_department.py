"""Choosing which department receives incoming tickets.

This started as the literal ``function_key == "ops_kam"``, so a workspace not set
up from the insurance-broking template auto-assigned nothing at all. That became
"the department behind the desk's first internal queue" — a fair guess, since the
bucket a new ticket starts in is by definition the team that fields it, but still
a guess: a desk whose first queue is Support while its intake team is Operations
had no way to say otherwise.

Now it is a setting, with the guess as its documented fallback. Both the
auto-assignment path and the digest resolve it through the same function on
purpose — a workspace where those two disagreed about who runs the desk would be
worse off than with either answer alone.
