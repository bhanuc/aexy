"""Applying one improvement suggestion.

The suggestion is a sentence of prose written by a model. It arrived as a query
parameter, which put arbitrary prose in a URL — a length limit, and a line in
every access log that keeps the document's contents. This pins it to a body,
and pins the part that matters more: applying does not touch the document, it
queues a proposal.
