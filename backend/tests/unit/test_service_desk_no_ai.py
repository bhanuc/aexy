"""Free mode — the desk must work end to end with AI switched off.

A desk that has AI switched off has to stand on its own: an email still becomes
a tracked ticket, the owner is still chosen by rule (partner mapping, else the
KAM pool), the clock still starts — and nothing in the path reaches a model or
opens a file.

"Off" is now stated rather than assumed. The desk follows the workspace's AI
switch, so these workspaces set the desk's own veto explicitly; relying on a
default meant that when the default changed the suite still passed — the model
call was made, raised, and was swallowed by the classifier's best-effort
``except``, which is precisely the regression these tests exist to catch.

These tests deliberately do NOT stub the classifier. They install a gateway and
an attachment fetcher that raise on use, so any AI or file read that creeps back
into the default path fails here instead of in front of an insurance customer.
