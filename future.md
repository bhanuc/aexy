lets add vibe-kanpan that allows user to execute any tasks in the ui via coding agents and open pull requests using freestyle.sh platform which allows dev servers creation on demand - we would also need to provide running custom docker images 
we need to build a proper notion alternative build on tiptap- that allows automatic creation and sync of documentations-  optionally via custom agent - where you can decribe the documementation and source of the documentation - by selecting bunch of repostisory as source and choose or create new template such as api routes from codebase - allowing all features likes embeding files - google drive links etc, s3 file integration as well- lets plan other features as well - we would also need to support importing exported project
