 * different screen from the same path without it — Planning has both, Board at
 * `/sprints` and Epics at `/sprints?tab=epics`. Matching on path alone lit both
 * of them at once, on every `/sprints/...` route, so the sidebar never said
 * which of the two you were looking at. The query-bearing entry has to match
 * the query; the bare entry has to lose whenever a sibling's query is the one
 * in force.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in the Sidebar component because it is a fact about
 * this configuration — two entries sharing a path — and it is worth testing
 * without mounting the whole navigation to do it.
