/**
 * Every translation key these surfaces ask for must exist in both locales.
 *
 * Caught by rendering, not by any test: the review inbox's approve-all button
 * displayed the literal string `review.approveAll`, because the key was never
 * added. next-intl renders the key path when it cannot resolve one, so a missing
 * key is not an error anywhere — it is a button with debug text on it, shipped.
 *
 * Scoped to the files this branch added or changed. A repo-wide sweep would fail
 * on gaps that are somebody else's to close and would say nothing about whether
 * this work is complete.
