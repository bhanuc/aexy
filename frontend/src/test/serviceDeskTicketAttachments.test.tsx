/**
 * Attachments on a Service Desk ticket detail page.
 *
 * They used to be filenames rendered as plain text: a KAM could see that a
 * claim register had arrived and had no way to open it, so the ticket could only
 * be worked from the mailbox it came from. What matters here is that the button
 * asks for the file by *position* — two replies can attach files with the same
 * name — and that a file the desk has no handle for offers no button at all,
 * because the download would only ever come back as an error.
